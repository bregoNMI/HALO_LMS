- Account settings page

- Demographics collection

- IDV (Identity Verification)

***************
Getting Started
***************

Prerequisites
=============

The `devstack`_ is currently recommended as a development environment for your
new MFE.  If you start it with ``make dev.up.lms`` that should give you
everything you need as a companion to this frontend.

Note that it is also possible to use `Tutor`_ to develop an MFE.  You can refer
to the `relevant tutor-mfe documentation`_ to get started using it.

.. _Devstack: https://github.com/openedx/devstack

.. _Tutor: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor

.. _relevant tutor-mfe documentation: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe#mfe-development

Installation
============

This MFE is bundled with `Devstack <https://github.com/openedx/devstack>`_, see the `Getting Started <https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started>`_ section for setup instructions.

1. Install Devstack using the `Getting Started <https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started>`_ instructions.

2. Start up Devstack, if it's not already started.

3. Log in to Devstack (http://localhost:18000/login )

4. Within this project, install requirements and start the development server:

   .. code-block::

      npm install
      npm start # The server will run on port 1997

5. Once the dev server is up, visit http://localhost:1997 to access the MFE

Plugins
=======
This MFE can be customized using `Frontend Plugin Framework <https://github.com/openedx/frontend-plugin-framework>`_.

The parts of this MFE that can be customized in that manner are documented `here </src/plugin-slots>`_.

Environment Variables/Setup Notes
=================================

This MFE is configured via environment variables supplied at build time.  All micro-frontends have a shared set of required environment variables, as documented in the Open edX Developer Guide under `Required Environment Variables <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-docs/en/latest/developers_guide/micro_frontends_in_open_edx.html#required-environment-variables>`__.

The account settings micro-frontend also supports the following additional variable:

``SUPPORT_URL``

Example: ``https://support.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the support page in the target environment.

``PASSWORD_RESET_SUPPORT_LINK``

Examples:

- ``https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/206212088-What-if-I-did-not-receive-a-password-reset-message-``

- ``mailto:support@example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the support page or email to request the support from in the target environment.

``ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DELETION``

Example: ``'false'`` | ``''`` (empty strings are true)

Enable the account deletion option, defaults to true.
To disable account deletion set ``ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DELETION`` to ``'false'`` (string), otherwise it will default to true.

edX-specific Environment Variables
==================================

Furthermore, there are several edX-specific environment variables that enable integrations with closed-source services private to the edX organization, and are unsupported in Open edX.  Enabling these environment variables will result in undefined behavior in Open edX installations:

``ENABLE_DEMOGRAPHICS_COLLECTION``

Example: ``true`` | ``''`` (empty strings are falsy)

Enables support for a section of the account settings page where a user can enter demographics information.  Integrates with a private demographics service and is only used by edx.org.

``DEMOGRAPHICS_BASE_URL``

Example: ``https://demographics.example.com``

Required only if ``ENABLE_DEMOGRAPHICS_COLLECTION`` is true.  The fully-qualified URL to the private demographics service in the target environment.

Example build syntax with a single environment variable:

.. code:: bash

   NODE_ENV=development ACCESS_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME='edx-jwt-cookie-header-payload' npm run build

For more information see the document: `Micro-frontend applications in Open
edX <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-docs/en/latest/developers_guide/micro_frontends_in_open_edx.html#required-environment-variables>`__.

Cloning and Startup
===================

.. code-block::


  1. Clone your new repo:

    ``git clone https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-account.git``

  2. Use node v18.x.

    The current version of the micro-frontend build scripts support node 18.
    Using other major versions of node *may* work, but this is unsupported.  For
    convenience, this repository includes an .nvmrc file to help in setting the
    correct node version via `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_.

  3. Install npm dependencies:

    ``cd frontend-app-account && npm ci``

  4. Start the dev server:

    ``npm start``

Known Issues
===========

None

Development Roadmap
===================

We don't have anything planned for the core of the MFE (the account settings page) - this MFE is currently in maintenance mode.
There may be a replacement for IDV coming down the pipe, so that may be DEPRed.
In the future, it's possible that demographics could be modeled as a plugin rather than being hard-coded into this MFE.
