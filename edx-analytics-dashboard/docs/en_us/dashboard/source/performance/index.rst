.. _Performance Index:

#############################
Student Performance
#############################

To assess how students are doing in your course, make a selection from the
**Performance** menu. Student performance data is available in edX Insights
for problem components of these types:

* Checkboxes

* Dropdown

* Multiple choice

* Numerical input

* Text input

* Math expression input

After you select **Graded Content**, edX Insights displays the grading
configuration for your course. You can review performance data for the
assignments and problems, and then the answers that students submitted for
assigned questions.

After you select **Ungraded Problems**, edX Insights displays the sections in
your course that contain ungraded problem components. You can review
performance data for ungraded problems by section and subsection, and then
examine the answers that students submitted for the problems.

For performance data to be available for either graded or ungraded course
content, at least one student must have submitted an answer for that problem.

Student submissions are updated every day. The computations use the last
answer submitted by each student and received through the end of the previous
day (23:59 UTC).
