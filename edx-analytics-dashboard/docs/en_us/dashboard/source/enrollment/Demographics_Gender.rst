What is the gender balance in my course? Knowing the male-female ratio in your
course can help you understand who is enrolling in your course and whether the
balance changes over time.

Learner demographic data is updated every day to include changes in enrollment
through 23:59 UTC the previous day.

Gaining Insight into Learner Gender
********************************************

Learners can identify themselves with a gender by selecting **Female**,
**Male**, or **Other/Prefer Not to Say** when they register for an account on
edx.org or edge.edx.org. Learner gender data is provided in a chart and a
report that you can view or download. Descriptions follow; for detailed
information about the computations, see
:ref:`Reference`.

======================================
Self-Reported Learner Gender Chart
======================================

The bars on this chart represent the most recently calculated percentage of
enrolled learners who reported a gender of **Female**, **Male**, or
**Other/Prefer Not to Say**. Moving your cursor over the chart shows the
percentage for each selection, calculated to one decimal place.

Learner gender data is also available for review in tabular format and can be
downloaded.

An example of this chart follows.

This chart is for a science course, and learners' median age is 25. The course
team might use the percentages of enrolled men and women as a starting point
for an investigation into how learners learn about their course and make the
decision to enroll in the course.

See the :ref:`Reference` for a detailed description of how learner gender
values are computed.

======================================
Gender Breakdown Over Time Report
======================================

The daily count of currently enrolled learners, with gender breakdown, is
available for review or download. Columns show each date, the current
enrollment as of that date, and breakdown columns for the number of people who
reported each gender category and who did not provide this information at
registration.

To download the Gender Breakdown Over Time report in a comma-separated value
file, click **Download CSV**. The CSV file contains the following columns:

* course_id
* created (the date and time of the computation)
* date
* female
* male
* other
* unknown

Researching an Unanticipated Disparity
===============================================

Not long before launch, the team for a math MOOC checked the demographics for
the learners who had enrolled. They were surprised to observe a gender
imbalance that was far more acute than they had ever seen in their on-campus
version of the class.

The team looked into possible contributing factors, and realized that the
audiences of the journal articles and blog posts that had been written about
the course skewed heavily male. They also reread the course About page to see
if it represented the course differently than they had intended.

Even more important to the team than finding potential causes was to make an
effort to enroll more women in the course. To do so, the team subsequently
partnered with professional womenâ€™s organizations for guidance on ways to
market the course to their members.

Today, teams can use edX Insights to monitor the success of such outreach
efforts by checking the Gender Breakdown Over Time report and CSV file for
enrollment trends.
