Gating E-Commerce Service Features
####################################

You can release new E-Commerce service features and functionality behind a
feature gate. This project uses the `Waffle <http://waffle.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_ library for feature gating.

****************************
Types of Feature Gates
****************************

Waffle supports the following types of feature gates.

* Flag: This gate allows you to enable a feature for specific users, groups,
  users who meet certain criteria (such as authenticated users or staff), or a
  certain percentage of visitors.

* Switch: This gate is a Boolean that turns a feature on or off for all
  users.

* Sample: This gate allows you to define the probability with which a given
  feature will be on.

For more information about creating or updating features and feature gates, see
the `Waffle documentation <http://waffle.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_.
