    Given a username and course ID or an order number and a course entitlement,

        * Order was placed by the User linked to username.
        * Order is in the COMPLETE state.

    Note that only the line items associated with the course ID will be refunded.
    Items associated with a different course ID, or not associated with any course ID, will NOT be refunded.

    With the exception of superusers, users may only create refunds for themselves.
